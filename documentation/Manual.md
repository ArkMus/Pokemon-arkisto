## Welcome to the world of pokemon!



The purpose of this website is to allow the user to add pokemon to their own collection and mark if a particular pokemon has been caught. 

### **USING THE WEBSITE WITHOUT A ACCOUNT**
Without creating a account, you can still click on "List of all the pokemon". This will show you a list of all the original 151 pokemon. You can also use the search function, but more on that in the "ADDING YOU FIRST POKEMON TO YOUR COLLECTION" section.



### **GETTING STARTED:**

The first thing you should want to do is to create a account, this is done by clicking "Register" in the upper right corner. The name you enter is used to greet you when you sign in and the username and password are used to sign in. Note that password has to be at least 8 characters! After creating you account you are redirected to the sign in page. Simply enter your username and password and you are in! 



### **ADDING YOU FIRST POKEMON TO YOUR COLLECTION**
When signed in, the new option "Collection" will be availabe in the navbar. If you click on it, it will take you to your collection, but it will be empty. Instead click on "List of all the pokemon". You are now greeted with a list of all the original 151 pokemon. If you are looking for a specific pokemon click on "Search for a pokemon". You can now search for pokemon by their name, number or both (**NOTE** that the name search **is** case sensitive). When you have found a pokemon you like click on "Add to your collection", you're taken to a page asking you to confirm that you want to add the pokemon to your collection, press the "Add pokemon" button. 



### **MANAGING YOUR COLLECTION**

If you now go back to your collection you will notice that your recently added pokemon is there. If you want to mark the pokemon as caught, press the "Catch the pokemon!" button, this will also increase your pokemon caught total by 1. If you want to reverse this, press the "Release the pokemon" button. If you wish to rename a pokemon in your collection, click on "Rename?", enter your desired name for the pokemon and press the "Rename pokemon" button. If you want to remove a pokemon completely from your collection, click on "Remove from collection" and confirm the removal by pressing the "Remove pokemon" button.
